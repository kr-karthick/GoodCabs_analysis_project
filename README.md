## 🚖 Goodcabs - Unlocking Data-Driven Growth! 🚀



## 📌 Overview

Welcome to my journey of completing Codebasics Resume Project Challenge #13, where I was tasked with analyzing and providing strategic insights to Goodcabs, a rapidly growing cab service in India’s tier-2 cities. Through this project, I dove deep into the Transportation & Mobility sector, focusing on enhancing growth and improving passenger satisfaction using data.

Goodcabs, operating in 10 tier-2 cities, supports local drivers and aims to offer better experiences to passengers. With ambitious performance goals for 2024, the company needed immediate insights to drive data-driven 
decision-making and boost performance.

# Primary Analysis:

Identify the top 3 and bottom 3 cities by total trips over the entire analysis period.


![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ff74b4b1-a7d4-4eb7-9e09-ab03687a2fd0)


Calculate the average fare per trip for each city and compare it with the city's average trip distance. Identify the cities with the highest and lowest average fare per trip to assess pricing efficiency across locations.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ba8649b4-09a5-4d1c-b7ba-7702f23bfe7b)

Calculate the average passenger and driver ratings for each city, segmented by passenger type (new vs. repeat). Identify cities with the highest and lowest average ratings.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3e53bb51-40a9-4e5a-872e-fb2af187fbf3)



For each city, identify the month with the highest total trips (peak demand) and the month with the lowest total trips (low demand). This analysis will help Goodcabs understand seasonal patterns and adjust resources accordingly.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e7511e65-b519-4557-ad31-189fb722d1ff)


Compare the total trips taken on weekdays versus weekends for each city over the six-month period. Identify cities with a strong preference for either weekend or weekday trips to understand demand variations.


![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/11233e18-2f18-4f95-8738-5859f35bc14b)


Analyse the frequency of trips taken by repeat passengers in each city (e.g., % of repeat passengers taking 2 trips, 3 trips, etc.). Identify which cities contribute most to higher trip frequencies among repeat passengers, and examine if there are distinguishable patterns between tourism-focused and business-focused cities.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b5b054b4-d1ea-40f9-9883-34dffe3af9a2)


For each city, evaluate monthly performance against targets for total trips, new passengers, and average passenger ratings from targets_db. Determine if each metric met, exceeded, or missed the target, and calculate the percentage difference. Identify any consistent patterns in target achievement, particularly across tourism versus business-focused cities.


![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a02478ce-077a-4dd7-ad4b-ae3f98a99050)

Analyse the Repeat Passenger Rate (RPR%) for each city across the six-month period. Identify the top 2 and bottom 2 cities based on their RPR% to determine which locations have the strongest and weakest rates.


Similarly, analyse the RPR% by month across all cities and identify the months with the highest and lowest repeat passenger rates. This will help to pinpoint any seasonal patterns or months with higher repeat passenger loyalty.
